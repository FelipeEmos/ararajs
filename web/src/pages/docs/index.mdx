# Introduction

AraraJS is a unique take on animation for <Link href="https://solidjs.com/" newTab>SolidJS</Link> that is basically asking the question:

- What if I want to animate the <b>signal</b> value?

Since SolidJS rendering and reactivity are very efficient, this is an exciting uncharted territory.

> **üöß Careful**: This is experimental, please be aware of that. Suggestions are very welcome and appreciated, please reach out in SolidJS' <Link href="https://discord.com/invite/solidjs" newTab>Discord Channel</Link> or write an <Link href="https://github.com/FelipeEmos/ararajs/issues" newTab>Issue</Link> if you think its' more suited.

## Is it for you?

Animation libraries are either very high level <i>(which is great when you're following a common use case)</i> or they are low level enough that it forces the programmer to leave the "reactive / declarative" mental model to deal with the animation's "imperative / sequential" nature.

You can think of AraraJS as a middle ground between the two. It's potentially more flexible than a high level solution but you won't leave the "reactive / declarative" mental model because you are still in signals land.

Some applications that may benefit grom this approach include:
- üèÉ Highly Reactive animations ( like reacting to mouse position )
- üß™ Mocking signal values
- üçé Physics based & procedural animations

### Emergent Behavior

Combining signals into derived signals is a remarkable DX from SolidJS, it's simple, it's powerful, it scales.

AraraJS's signals can also be derived and combined in cleaver ways. A simple combination can emerge new exciting behavior which you'll have full control of. Look at what is possible with only <Link href="">spring</Link> and <Link href="">sine wave</Link> primitives combined together (with mouse position) in this <Link href="/docs/examples/hover-card/" newTab>Hover Card</Link>.

> <b> üìñ Recommended reading</b>: This <Link href="https://motion.dev/docs/feature-comparison" newTab>article from Motion</Link> is a feature comparison of some animation libraries. It also explores their different Web API strategies and how it affect's the user.  In case you are wondering, AraraJS is using the api `requestAnimationFrame` under the hood because it operates only on `signals / javascript` land.
