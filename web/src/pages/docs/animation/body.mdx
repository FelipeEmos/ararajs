# Body

Bodies are very simple. They are just the AraraJS way of outputting animated signals. In case you are interested in the speed in which your signal is changing, for example, you can access the `velocity` and `acceleration` properties of the `Body` object.

<Code
  code={`
type Body = {
    position: number
    velocity: number
    acceleration: number
}
`}
  lang="tsx"
/>

## 2D and 3D variants

For your convenience, AraraJS provides primitives for 2D and 3D animations as well. For example `createSpring2D` will return an accessor for a `Body2D`

<Code
  code={`
  const [body2d] = createSineWave2D({
    phase: [Math.PI / 2, 0],
  })
`}
  lang="tsx"
/>

<ExampleWrapper
  codeSnippets={[
    {
      name: 'code',
      files: [
        {
          fileName: 'sine-wave-2d-demo.tsx',
          slotName: 'sine-wave-2d-demo',
        },
      ],
    },
  ]}
  height="dynamic"
  client:idle
>
  <SineWave2DDemo client:load />
  <RawCode slot="sine-wave-2d-demo" code={RawSineWave2DDemo} lang="tsx" />
</ExampleWrapper>

The 2D and 3D variants use vectors from the <Link href="https://glmatrix.net/" newTab>gl-matrix</Link> library.
> These types `vec2` and `vec3` are exposed to you by directly importing from AraraJS.

<Code
  code={`
import { vec2, vec3 } from 'ararajs'
// Equilalent to
import { vec2, vec3 } from 'gl-matrix'


type Body2D = {
    position: vec2
    velocity: vec2
    acceleration: vec2
}

type Body3D = {
    position: vec3
    velocity: vec3
    acceleration: vec3
}
`}
  lang="tsx"
/>
