# Animation <span class="text-arara-text/50">Overview</span>

AraraJS's execution model is supposed to be minimal, powerful and flexible.
Some of it's features include:

<Features
  features={[
    'Frame-based animation loop with precise timing control',
    'Composable animation callbacks for complex behaviors',
    'Smart state management with automatic cleanup',
    'Server-side rendering compatible',
  ]}
/>

## Bare Metal API

The animation system is built around some basic building blocks:

- Animation Callbacks - Just a function that is called on each frame.
- Animation Controller - Manages the animation loop and timing.

These basic building blocks don't output a signal for you, they just manage timing and possibly orchestration of your animations.

## Body Animations

To get an output signal in a more convenient way, you may want to create a `Body` animation. Maybe you are not interested in how your signal change, which is the concept of `velocity`, but keep in mind that both `velocity` and `acceleration` are present in the `Body` object returned by the signal in case you need them in some point.

Maybe you won't use them all, but the primitives come with them.

## Composition and Other Primitives

Some common body animation primitives, like `spring` and `sine wave`, are available to you by the library. They come both in the form of just a callback, a `BodyAnimationPass`, which is a callback that apply changes to the body on every frame, and they also come in more convenient `createSpring`, `createSine`, ... variants.

<Code code={`
const [sine] = createSineWave()
// is equivalent to
const [sine] = createBodyAnimation(() => [
    sineWavePass()
])
`} lang='tsx' />

Using the `BodyAnimationPass` will give you more flexibility because you can input multiple passes in a `createBodyAnimation` and these passes are applied in order. It's easy to combine multiple Sines and Springs with that, which gives you easings and periodic behaviours.
