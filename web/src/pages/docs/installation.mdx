export const components = { h2: H2, h3: H3 }

# Installation
arara provides every UI primitive as a separate package. This allows you to only install the primitives you need, to use the semver of every package as a reference for breaking/feature changes and progressively update packages in case of new versions.

For example the drawer component is available as `@corvu/drawer`:
<Code code={`
npm install @corvu/drawer
`} lang="bash" copyButton />

If you want to install all primitives at once you can install the main package. Unused primitives will get tree-shaken by your bundler, so you don't have to worry about the bundle size.

<Code code={`
npm install arara
`} lang="bash" copyButton />

You're good to go! Head over to [Usage](/docs/state/) to learn how to use arara.

## TailwindCSS plugin
If you want make use of the tailwind modifiers like `arara-open:`, install the tailwind plugin:

<Code code={`
npm install @corvu/tailwind
`} lang="bash" copyButton />

Then add the plugin to your `tailwind.config.js` file:

<Code code={`
module.exports = {
  // ...
  plugins: [
    // Use it with the default prefix 'arara'
    require('@corvu/tailwind'),
    // or with a custom prefix
    require('@corvu/tailwind')({ prefix: 'ui' }),
    // ...
  ],
}
`} lang="js" />

Check out the [TailwindCSS](/docs/styling/#tailwindcss-plugin) section in the styling guide to learn more about the tailwind plugin.
