# Dynamic Components

All primitive components that render a DOM element, are dynamic. This means that you can modify the element or the component they should render as.

## Native elements

In most cases, you shouldn't need to change the DOM element that the primitive component renders. corvu has sensible defaults for all components. But there are cases where it makes sense to change them. An example would be the `Tooltip` trigger which renders as a `button` element. You may want to render a tooltip on a link (`a` tag) instead. To do this, you have to specify the `as` property on the trigger component:
<Code code={`
<Tooltip.Trigger as="a" href="https://corvu.dev">
  corvu.dev
</Tooltip.Trigger>
`} lang="tsx" />

## Solid components

A much more common use case is to render a primitive component as a custom Solid component. This is useful to apply default styling or to add additional functionality.

For example, you might have your own, custom-styled button component and want to use it as a trigger for a dialog:
<Code code={`
const CustomButton = (props: {
  variant: 'fill' | 'outline'
  children: JSX.Element
}) => {
  const [local, rest] = splitProps(props, ['variant'])
  // Apply your custom styling here
  return <button class="..." {...rest} />
}

const DialogTrigger = () => (
  <Dialog.Trigger as={CustomButton} variant="outline">
    Open
  </Dialog.Trigger>
)
`} lang="tsx" />

Props not belonging to the primitive component will be passed to the component you defined.

> ‚ùó To ensure functionality and accessibility, your component needs to accept props defined by the primitive component. To do this, you need to spread the received props onto your element. Otherwise, things will break.

### Using corvu props for yourself

In the rare cases where your component accepts a property that the corvu primitive component itself uses (like the `as` property here), you can create a wrapper component around it, like this:

<Code code={`
type CustomButtonProps = {
  as: string
  variant: 'fill' | 'outline'
  children: JSX.Element
}

const CustomButton = (props: CustomButtonProps) => {
  const [local, rest] = splitProps(props, ['as', 'variant'])
  // Apply your custom styling here
  return <Dynamic component={local.as} {...rest} />
}

const DialogTrigger = () => {
  return (
    <Dialog.Trigger
      as={(props: Omit<CustomButtonProps, 'as'>) => (
        <CustomButton as="button" {...props} />
      )}
      variant="outline"
    >
      Open
    </Dialog.Trigger>
  )
}
`} lang="tsx" />

You need to type the `props` to omit all props you already define inside the wrapper function and you're good to go!
